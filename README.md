## Academic Success Factors in High School Students
This exploratory data analysis project is focused on a dataset of 2,392 high school students with their demographics, study habits, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, and academic performance. The goal is to visualize the different factors influencing the students' academic performance.

This repository has our jupyter notebooks reading the dataset under Input folder and writing the charts/graphs under Output folder, and our reference documents under Resource folder.

Check out the Analysis and Conclusion document for our final analysis where our conclusion states that absences is the only factor that has a strong influence on the students' GPA, and the students' average performance is poor.
